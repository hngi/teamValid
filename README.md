# teamValid
 A simple log in and registration Page.
## How it works
It allows user input and doesn't store information in database it uses, a JSON format to store and retrieve information.

## INSTALLATION
Just clone / download the repository, move the folder into your xampp or wamp folder, cause it runs on php.
In your browser just type **localhost/teamValid**
